use npm install for both the client and server folders 

npm start to start the client side 
node app.js to start the server

your mongodb must be on and appropriate connection must be established 
user data is stored in localstorage for borrowing of books while the
user login and signup data is stored securely in the mongodb database

In my mongodb i have used normal mongodb not atlas so my connection string or url mongodb is "mongodb://localhost:27017/librarymanagement"
alos PORT=5000
